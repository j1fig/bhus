bhus
====

Irish for bus.
API to interact with Dublin's operators, vehicles and stops.


## Setup

### Dependencies

1. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. [PostgreSQL client](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients) - I recommend [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/install).


### Starting the local environment

	./run.sh

This will start a docker-compose environment, pulling in the necessary base images and initializing your database and the service automatically.



### Connecting to the local database

The credentials to connect to the Postgres server are exposed in the `.env` file in the root of the repo.
To save some time, here's the raw connection URL you might want to use to connect to the database with `pgcli`.

	pgcli postgres://bhus:bhus@localhost/bhus

TODO - connect via a port other than 5432 as it conflicts in case the developer has a PG server running in their host.

## Roadmap

1. build the service API.
2. add documentation to launch the service if needed.
3. add API documentation (best if autogenerated, accessible via a webpage that the service provides) - think OpenAPI 3.0+, Swagger.
